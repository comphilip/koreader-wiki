KOReader can search a book on your device by filename.

Invoke a search via filebrowser main menu `Search` - `File search` or with an assigned gesture.

![filesearch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62179190/113472225-6eb91680-946a-11eb-917f-9e3526837afa.png)

Start a search from the current folder or from the Home folder. Subfolders are included.

If `Show hidden files` in the filebrowser settings is enabled, search results will include hidden files.

If `Show unsupported files` in the filebrowser settings is enabled, search results will include unsupported files.

A search for `*` ([single asterisk](https://github.com/koreader/koreader/pull/7362)) will show all files.

Search string can include special characters in accordance with the [Lua patterns](https://www.lua.org/pil/20.2.html).

Tap a supported file in the search results to open it.
