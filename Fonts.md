KOReader has some built-in fonts, and you can also install your own fonts.

## Installing Fonts

You *must* use [`.ttf`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueType) (TrueType Fonts). You cannot use `.woff`, `.woff2`, `.eot`, `.svg` or other font types.

Also, when adding fonts, they can be in many different types (i.e. different file names). Very useful info about which font types (i.e. file names) to use you can find [here.](https://github.com/koreader/koreader/issues/4174#issuecomment-698520071)

### Android
On Android devices, copy the `.ttf` font file to:

`/koreader/fonts/`

You may need to create the `/fonts/` directory

### PocketBook

For each font, make a directory in `/applications/koreader/fonts/` and copy the `.ttf` file(s) there.
