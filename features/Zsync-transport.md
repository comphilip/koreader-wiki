With the `Zsync` plungin multiple Koreader devices in the same Wifi network can transfer documents between each other directly without bothering to copying document files via USB cable in another computer.

### Publish this document
After tapping the `Publish this document` menu Koreader will share current document to other Koreader devices in your local network.

### Subscribe documents
After tapping the `Subscribe documents` menu Koreader will receive documents from other devices in your local network. Before real receiving Koreader will popup a `Choose inbox` window and ask you where to save received documents. Long tap on the directory name will set that directory as inbox directory.
