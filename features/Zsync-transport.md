With the `Zsync` plugin, multiple Koreader devices in the same Wifi network can transfer documents between each other directly without bothering to copying document files via USB cable on another computer.

### Publish this document
After tapping the `Publish this document` menu KOReader will share the current document to other KOReader devices on your local network.

### Subscribe documents
After tapping the `Subscribe documents` menu KOReader will receive documents from other devices on your local network. Before real receiving, KOReader will pop up a `Choose inbox` window and ask you where to save received documents. Long tap on the directory name will set that directory as inbox directory.
