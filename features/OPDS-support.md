This plugin adds an OPDS browser to the filemanager, which lets you browse public online OPDS catalogs and download ebooks from these. You can even add your own custom OPDS server. An overview of OPDS catalogs can be found in the [MobileRead Wiki](https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/OPDS).

**Note**: In order to access an OPDS catalog search you have to go to file browser (the OPDS catalog button is not available in book reading mode)
