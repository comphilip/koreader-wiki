Following is the guide to install and launch **KPV** using launchpad.

For up-to-date instructions regarding **KOReader**, see [this page instead](../KOReader-User-Guide).

1. Jailbreak your Kindle.

2. Install "Launchpad" tool.

3.  Firstly download the latest release from the [[Download]] page.

4.  Create a folder named "customupdates" on the Kindle and copy the zip file into it.

5.  Press Shift-Shift-I sequence on the Kindle for installion
    (if this is the first time you use launchpad: you only have 0.7 secs for the sequence!).

6.  Press Shift-Shift-Space sequence on the Kindle to reload launchpad.

7.  Done! now you can run the viewer via a Shift-P-D sequence.


While Launchpad is handy, it's not very user friendly. You might also want to
try [KUAL][kual], which is an awesome GUI launcher for all kindle devices.
