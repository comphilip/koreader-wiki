## Installation

For up-to-date instructions, see [this page](../KOReader-User-Guide).

NOTE: After a firmware update, you will most likely have to reinstall some stuff. Of particular importance to KOReader: KPVBooklet if you're using it, and [MKK](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=233932) if you're using [KUAL](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=203326).
