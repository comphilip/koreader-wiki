# This plugin is currently broken. Please see https://github.com/koreader/koreader/issues/6281#issuecomment-653792688 for more information.

This plugin has been replaced with [Highlight exporter](https://github.com/koreader/koreader/wiki/Highlight-export). 

The bundled Evernote export plugin is able to export [highlights](https://github.com/koreader/koreader/wiki/Clipboard) and notes added from both native reader in Kindle and the Koreader itself to Evernote cloud. And Yinxiang Biji (Evernote in China) is also supported.

Even highlights in scanned pages from PDF and DJVU documents are easy to be exported to Evernote by a single tap.
