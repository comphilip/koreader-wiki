With the `Zsync` plugin, multiple Koreader devices on the same Wifi network can transfer documents directly to one another.

### Sending a document
Open the document you would like to share. Select the `ZSync` > `Share this document` menu option and KOReader will make the current document available to other KOReader devices on your local network.

### Receiving a document
Open any existing document and select `ZSync` > `Subscribe to book share`. KOReader will ask you where to save the document(s) you will receive; long-tap on a directory to select it. KOReader will soon receive documents currently shared by other devices on your local network.
