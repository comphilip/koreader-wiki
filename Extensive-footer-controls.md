Footer is highly configurable, enabling almost anyone to set it up to own taste.

You have sort manager to sort footer elements in order you prefer:

More info on sorting footer elements can be found [here.](https://github.com/koreader/koreader/pull/5389)

You can place progress bar in second line, allowing all other footer elements to be visible at once with enough room:

More info on progress bar in second line can be found [here.](https://github.com/koreader/koreader/pull/5405)

Progress bar's outlook can also be extensively controlled:

* removed LineWidget changes,
* adapted ProgressWidget to show thin bar,
* ability to choose progress bar width (edge to edge, balanced, like book margins),
* ability to choose progress bar height (from 1 to 4 px for thin bar style and from 5 to 14 for thick bar),
* removed DMINIBAR_HEIGHT - now is set up by bar height in Progress bar style,
* ability to set up bar position (top, bottom, aside)
