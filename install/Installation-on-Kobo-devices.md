## Touch, Mini, Glo, Glo HD, Aura HD, H2O

__Recommended installation based on Start Menu:__
- Install [**Kobo Start Menu**](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=266821)
- Download either the latest stable version (https://github.com/koreader/koreader/releases/tag/v2015.11-stable) or one of the nightly builds of KOReader (http://build.koreader.rocks/download/nightly)
- Extract the `koreader` folder of the zip into the `.adds` directory of your device. You don't need `KoboRoot.tgz` or `koreader.png` unless you're using the older installation based on Filemonitor. (See below.) If you are using a version of KSM older than version 8, please extract to the `.kobo` folder instead.

Now you should be able to select KOReader in the Kobo Start Menu.


__Older installation based on Filemonitor:__

**WARNING: Since Filemonitor does not play well with KOReader, only use it if Kobo Start Menu does not work for you**.

- Put the image included in the zip (called `koreader.png`) in the main folder of your Kobo and disconnect it from your computer. Open the image on the reader, go back to the home screen and then, just to be extra-safe, reboot it.
- Install **Files Monitor** (http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=218283).
- Extract the remaining content of the zip into the `.kobo` directory (both `KoboRoot.tgz` and the `koreader` folder). 

Selecting the KOReader icon in your home, you will be able to launch KOReader. Simple enough, isn't it? Just be sure to process the image properly (follow those steps carefully) if it's the first time you install KOReader, if you made a factory reset or if you deleted it in some way, otherwise you could end up launching KOReader automatically at every boot, being unable to exit it without a factory reset.

When you update KOReader, it should be sufficient to extract the `koreader` folder, without `KoboRoot.tgz` â€” that one is needed to add the launcher.

## Aura One, Aura Edition 2, H2O2

__Recommended installation based on Start Menu:__

- After installing Kobo Start Menu ([**normal version**](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=266821), it will boot with very small text and icons on KA1)
- Upgrade KSM to [**KA1 version**](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=3389190&postcount=221)
- Use either a stable version of KOReader **newer than v2015.11 excluded** or a nightly build of KOReader. Extract the `koreader` folder of the zip into the `.adds` directory of your device. `KoboRoot.tgz` and `koreader.png` are not needed.

Now you should be able to select KOReader in the Kobo Start Menu.
