With Calibre Companion plugin you can send documents from your Calibre library directly to your KOReader devices via Wifi connection.

To use this plugin you need to keep your PC that runs Calibre and your KOReader device in one local network usually in one router. Then start your Calibre wireless device connection as the following screenshot shows:

Use the default option in the popup window should be OK as for Calibre version 2.2.

After the calibre wireless device connection is established (the red indicator of the connection button changes into green), go to the plugin tab of KOReader and select "connect" option in the "Calibre Companion" plugin. If all things go right Koreader should say "Connected to Calibre Server at _somehost:someport_" and your Calibre should recognize KOReader as a wireless device like this:
