## Introduction

As you've probably guessed, kindlepdfviewer, or KPDFviewer, is a document viewer for the Kindle.  Not just for PDFs but also DjVu, XPS, CBZ, FB2, TXT, HTML, RTF, CHM, EPUB, DOC, MOBI, and ZIP files.  The initial kindlepdfviewer was built by [hawhill](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/member.php?u=86292) based on the [mupdf](http://www.mupdf.com/) source.  Since then it has come a long way, based on requests and updates by hawhill, dpavlin, NuPogodi, trigan, chrox, kai, traycold, houqp and others on the [mobileread forums](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=157047).
