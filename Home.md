## Introduction

KOReader is a document viewer for the Linux based eink devices. The formats it supports includes Pdf, DjVu, XPS, CBZ, FB2, TXT, HTML, RTF, CHM, EPUB, DOC, MOBI, and ZIP files.

KOReader is rewritten from kindlepdfviewer, which is originally built by [hawhill](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/member.php?u=86292) based on the [mupdf](http://www.mupdf.com/) source. Since then it has come a long way, based on requests and updates by hackers around the world.

There is a related discussion thread on the MobileRead Forums, one of the biggest english language web forums for e-book publishing: http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=209276
