## Introduction

KOReader is a document viewer for the Linux based eink devices. The formats it supports includes Pdf, DjVu, XPS, CBZ, FB2, PDB, TXT, HTML, RTF, CHM, EPUB, DOC, MOBI, and ZIP files.

KOReader is rewritten from kindlepdfviewer, which is originally built by [hawhill](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/member.php?u=86292) based on the [mupdf](http://www.mupdf.com/) source. Since then it has come a long way, based on requests and updates by hackers around the world.

There are related discussion threads on the MobileRead Forums, one of the largest English language web forums for e-book reading/publishing:

For a more thorough division for different devices please take a look at [NiLuJe's builds](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=2658945&postcount=2). Here, for instance, you will find KOReader for non-touch Kindles among others too! (weekly-ish builds, not tied to any stable/nightly tag. The device separation stems from the custom, highly device-specific toolchains used).
